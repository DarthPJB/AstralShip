The mission statement is a set of ethic principles. These principles describe the believes of the project members and set a direction</p><p>provided to the client,</p><p>selling a product, the group must provide a service that benefits the community while reciving money for the product.</p><p>This requires the acceptance of feedback.</p><p>The product must have a place, and generate connections to provide resources to continue;<br>
These statements are important to making the decisitions.</p><p>(Captain)<br>
We should propose our needs and ideals towards the mission, to ensure everyone is on the same page; and to give the claims of the hope talk substance.</p><p>This senario is no decentralised, Liam is handling all costs and appropriations.</p><p>Last year (2019) was very fun, but difficult, energy was high, productivity was low;</p><p>Energy use, savings; concerns about energy use; such as heaters; lighting; etc.</p><p>(John)<br>
Energy usage must be sanity checked; Led Lightbulbs should be standard; energy monitoring should be checked.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Disipline is important, anarchistic tradgey of commons must be avoided</p><p>(Manwell)<br>
Agree on what lights should be left on</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Liam raised the energy use to illustrate the point that we must maintain disipline to conserve financial stability.</p><p>Liam concerned we don’t have enough time for the project to achive the goals it needs to.</p><p>I want play to be a fundimental part of our work, but that cannot reduce our productivity.</p><p>(Leslie)<br>
There is a great deal of enthusiasm for these projects in the world, and people who have self dicipline.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
We need to keep our head-start against other similar projects.</p><p>We need to keep focused.</p><p>(Gina)<br>
we need rules and agreements</p><p>(John)<br>
Productivity = Efficiency / Time<br>
Agreements must be upheld and accountability kept.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Long term memebers must have different agreements to short term visits</p><p>(Leslie) Agree</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Short term stay persons should be given direction<br>
Reward for effort, and our economic status.</p><p>(John)<br>
One must not overwork themselves without reward.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Productivity is effected by drug usage and intoxication - don’t smoke to much.</p><p>(Gina)<br>
Making Money means doing things you don’t want to do, sometimes.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
we must belive in the mission of the ship; otherwise we cannot continue;</p><p>(John)<br>
The hope Talk made the vision cemented in my eyes.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
The content of the hope talk hasn’t changed from a year ago, but it does help cement the understanding of the core team.<br>
Offering other viewpoints is important; and debating things is important.<br>
An idea such as this must not contain faliciies or bias, it is important to find and remove things.</p><p>(John)<br>
We should have a good system, but we must use whatever software we choose, and actually USE IT.</p><p>(Leslie)<br>
We have to do things and not be overwhelmed by ideas.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Weed can give us many ideas, we have so many ideas, and the many ideas can pile up, and we do not complete them, so more pile up.</p><p>(Gina)<br>
we have no need to be hard on ourselves.</p><p>(John)<br>
I started my vaction on Friday</p><p>(Leslie)<br>
Every here is sane and rational now.</p><h3 id="A-BREAK-IN-THE-MEETING-HAPPENS-HERE">A BREAK IN THE MEETING HAPPENS HERE</h3><p><strong>I Intened to resume with a verbal proposal for Project Pathfinder (As we appear to be about to talk about ship Direction)</strong></p><h3 id="End-Break">End Break</h3><p>(Liam)<br>
In the bibilical story of seven years of famine and seven years of faminie<br>
I feel like we are in the end of the seven years of plenty, and we are not prepared for the seven years of famine.<br>
We feel like we have good skills and we are building up what we can do, we can contribute to a local or global economy, and support ourselves.<br>
I don’t want anyone to be stressed beyond the point it’s unhealthy, it’s like the buddah and the string.<br>
we must make the rigging of the ship slack and tight.</p><p>After the airBnB summer, we let things slip a bit in october.</p><p>by the end of the year we must feel we should have solid prospects.</p><p>(l33)<br>
There’s a lot of things happening, the goverment is pouring money onto everything.</p><p>Everyone knows everyone around here, and I’m hoping the director of Mspark can build our buisness network.</p><p>(Liam)<br>
Let’s form a circle</p><p>Let’s talk about our needs.<br>
I created the Astral Ship project due to fear of social or economic collapse.</p><p>I built this ship hoping to survive what was coming, and perhaps find a way to make a difference along the way</p><p>I feel everyone aboard needs to be focused on something, we need to support eachother.<br>
I don’t want this to be a hirachical project, a millitary group with orders or courtmartial.</p><p>Today I would like to get towards a simple agreement, a mission statement, ideas of how we work together - and that way things that are focused on me are shared with the core team, that our financial situation, what efforts are made, we need to make sure the ship doesn’t go down.</p><p>The need I most have is that we don’t allow chaos to reign, i want creativity and that invovles chaos - when communication is not clear, frustrations develop that kill productivity, and this is essential to survival in my perspective.</p><p>&lt; Recording devices are updated here&gt;</p><p>(John)<br>
